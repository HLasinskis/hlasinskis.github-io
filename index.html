                    and primarily features characters from various Nintendo franchises.
                    The series was created by Masahiro Sakurai, who has directed every game in the series.
                    The gameplay objective differs from that of traditional fighters in that the aim is to knock opponents off the stage
                    instead of depleting life bars.</p>

                    It was released worldwide after selling over a million copies in Japan.
                    It featured eight characters from the start (Mario, Donkey Kong, Link, Samus, Yoshi, Kirby, Fox, and Pikachu),
                    with four unlockable characters (Luigi, Captain Falcon, Ness, and Jigglypuff),
                    all of them created by Nintendo or one of its second-party developers.</p>

                    and in Europe and Australia in May 2002. It had a larger budget and development team than Super Smash Bros.
                    did and was released to much greater praise and acclaim among critics and consumers. Since its release, Super Smash Bros. Melee has sold more than 7 million copies and was the bestselling game on the GameCube.
                    Super Smash Bros. Melee features 26 characters, of which 15 are available initially, more than doubling the number of characters in its predecessor.
                    There are also 29 stages.</p>

                    Nintendo unveiled its first information in the form of a trailer in 2006, and the game was named Super Smash Bros. Brawl and released worldwide in 2008.
                    The game featured a set of third-party characters, Solid Snake of Konami's Metal Gear series, and longtime Mario rival Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega's series of the same name.
                    Brawl was also the first game in the franchise to support online play, via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, and to offer the ability for players to construct their own original stages.
                    The game features a total of 39 playable characters and 41 stages.</p>

                <hr>
                <p class="lead">At E3 2011, it was confirmed that a fourth Super Smash Bros. game would be coming to the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U,
                    with the two games being cross-compatible with each other. Sakurai stated that the announcement was made public in order to attract developers needed for the games,
                    as development for the games did not start until May 2012 due to production on Kid Icarus: Uprising. On June 21, 2012, Nintendo announced that the creation of the games would be a co-production between Sakurai's Sora Ltd.
                    and Bandai Namco Entertainment. The games were officially revealed at E3 2013, with new information being released via trailers, Nintendo Direct presentations, and developer posts on Miiverse.
                    The game features 58 characters, 19 of whom are new, and 7 of whom are downloadable. The downloadable fighters are Mewtwo from Pokémon, Lucas from Mother 3, Roy from Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade, Ryu from Street Fighter,
                    Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII, Corrin from Fire Emblem Fates and Bayonetta. The game was released for Nintendo 3DS in Japan in September 2014, and in North America, Europe, and Australia the following month.
                    The Wii U version was released North America, Europe, and Australia in November 2014, and in Japan the following month.</p>

                <hr>
                <p class="lead">On March 8, 2018, a teaser for the game was shown during a Nintendo Direct.
                    Sakurai later confirmed that he had worked on the game "in silence, day after day." On March 22, 2018, Nintendo announced that they would host another Super Smash Bros. Invitational tournament,
                    in which a selected group of players would get to play the game for the first time and compete in a series of matches before a winner is chosen. The tournament took place alongside the Splatoon 2 World Championship at E3 2018 and was held on June 11–12.
                    Both events were live streamed on Nintendo's official YouTube and Twitch channels. The title was confirmed as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate at E3 2018, where it was also announced that it would contain all playable characters from every previous game.
                    The game was released worldwide on December 7, 2018; according to the review aggregator platform Metacritic, it received "universal critical acclaim" from critics.
                    New characters include Inkling from Splatoon, Ridley from Metroid, King K. Rool from Donkey Kong, Isabelle from Animal Crossing, Simon from Castlevania and Incineroar from Pokémon,
                    as well as Echo Fighters Daisy (based on Peach) from Mario, Richter (based on Simon) from Castlevania, Chrom (based on Roy) from Fire Emblem Awakening, Ken (based on Ryu) from Street Fighter and Dark Samus (based on Samus) from Metroid Prime.
                    In addition, Piranha Plant from the Super Mario games, Joker from Persona 5, the Hero character from Dragon Quest XI, Banjo and Kazooie from the Banjo-Kazooie series, and Terry Bogard from the Fatal Fury series were announced as downloadable fighters for Ultimate.</p>

                        With only one more best-of-five win required, Nairo met MKLeo’s Joker.
                        It was the first time Nairo played against Joker in this tournament, and it showed.
                        MKLeo was able to reset the bracket off of a 3-0 stomp.
                        A fourth straight win would put him up in the true Grand Finals, but Nairo would not let this chance slip away.
                        Looking to have figured out the matchup after losing four games in a row, Nairo pulled back the set and won three in a row.</p>
